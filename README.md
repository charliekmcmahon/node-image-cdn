# node-image-cdn
A small node.js web app that lets you easily upload and host files. Uses express, multer and ejs.

Feel free to fork. Edit public/index.html for the upload page and views/res.ejs for the response page.

All files uploaded are stored at /uploads

<b>This was made to host small image files easily, but can be used to host anything really.</b>
